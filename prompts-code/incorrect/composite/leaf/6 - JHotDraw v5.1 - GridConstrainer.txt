Given the following java code, determine whether it contains an instance of the composite design pattern playing the role of leaf.

You should read the entire code snippet carefully. Then answer with YES or NO in capital letters. Finally, In 2-3 short sentences, explain why that is the answer

CODE:


package CH.ifa.draw.standard;

import java.awt.Point;
import java.io.Serializable;

import CH.ifa.draw.framework.PointConstrainer;




public class GridConstrainer implements PointConstrainer, Serializable {

	private int fGridX;
	private int fGridY;

	public GridConstrainer(int x, int y) {
		fGridX = Math.max(1, x);
		fGridY = Math.max(1, y);
	}

	
	public Point constrainPoint(Point p) {
		p.x = ((p.x+fGridX/2) / fGridX) * fGridX;
		p.y = ((p.y+fGridY/2) / fGridY) * fGridY;
		return p;
	}

	
	public int getStepX() {
		return fGridX;
	}

	
	public int getStepY() {
		return fGridY;
	}
}
