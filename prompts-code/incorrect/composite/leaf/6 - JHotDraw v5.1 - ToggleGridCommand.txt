Given the following java code, determine whether it contains an instance of the composite design pattern playing the role of leaf.

You should read the entire code snippet carefully. Then answer with YES or NO in capital letters. Finally, In 2-3 short sentences, explain why that is the answer

CODE:


package CH.ifa.draw.standard;

import java.awt.Point;

import CH.ifa.draw.framework.DrawingView;
import CH.ifa.draw.framework.PointConstrainer;
import CH.ifa.draw.util.Command;


public class ToggleGridCommand extends Command {

	private DrawingView fView;
	private Point fGrid;

   
	public ToggleGridCommand(String name, DrawingView view, Point grid) {
		super(name);
		fView = view;
		fGrid = new Point(grid.x, grid.y);
	}

	public void execute() {
		PointConstrainer grid = fView.getConstrainer();
		if (grid != null) {
			fView.setConstrainer(null);
		}
		else {
			fView.setConstrainer(new GridConstrainer(fGrid.x, fGrid.y));
		}
	}
}
