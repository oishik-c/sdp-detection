Given the following java code, determine whether it contains an instance of the composite design pattern playing the role of leaf.

You should read the entire code snippet carefully. Then answer with YES or NO in capital letters. Finally, In 2-3 short sentences, explain why that is the answer

CODE:


package CH.ifa.draw.standard;

import java.util.Vector;

import CH.ifa.draw.framework.Figure;
import CH.ifa.draw.framework.Handle;



 

public class BoxHandleKit {

	
	static public void addCornerHandles(Figure f, Vector handles) {
		handles.addElement(southEast(f));
		handles.addElement(southWest(f));
		handles.addElement(northEast(f));
		handles.addElement(northWest(f));
	}

	
	static public void addHandles(Figure f, Vector handles) {
		addCornerHandles(f, handles);
		handles.addElement(south(f));
		handles.addElement(north(f));
		handles.addElement(east(f));
		handles.addElement(west(f));
	}

	static public Handle south(Figure owner) {
		return new SouthHandle(owner);
	}

	static public Handle southEast(Figure owner) {
		return new SouthEastHandle(owner);
	}
