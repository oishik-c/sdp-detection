Given the following java code, determine whether it contains an instance of the composite design pattern playing the role of composite.

You should read the entire code snippet carefully. Then answer with YES or NO in capital letters. Finally, In 2-3 short sentences, explain why that is the answer

CODE:


package CH.ifa.draw.standard;

import java.awt.Point;

import CH.ifa.draw.framework.Connector;
import CH.ifa.draw.framework.Figure;



public class ChangeConnectionEndHandle extends ChangeConnectionHandle {

	
	public ChangeConnectionEndHandle(Figure owner) {
		super(owner);
	}

	
	protected Connector target() {
		return fConnection.end();
	}

	
	protected void disconnect() {
		fConnection.disconnectEnd();
	}

	
	protected void connect(Connector c) {
		fConnection.connectEnd(c);
	}

	
	protected void setPoint(int x, int y) {
		fConnection.endPoint(x, y);
	}

	
	public Point locate() {
		return fConnection.endPoint();
	}
}
