    Map getVariableDeclarations(boolean lookingForUsed);

    
    void addDeclaration(VariableNameDeclaration decl);

    
    void addDeclaration(MethodNameDeclaration decl);

    
    boolean contains(NameOccurrence occ);

    
    NameDeclaration addVariableNameOccurrence(NameOccurrence occ);

    
    void setParent(Scope parent);

    
    Scope getParent();

    
    ClassScope getEnclosingClassScope();
}
