Given the following java code, determine whether it contains an instance of the adapter design pattern playing the role of adapter.

You should read the entire code snippet carefully. Then answer with YES or NO in capital letters. Finally, In 2-3 short sentences, explain why that is the answer

CODE:



package net.nutch.net;

import net.nutch.util.*;
import java.util.logging.*;


public class URLFilterFactory {
  private static final Logger LOG =
    LogFormatter.getLogger("net.nutch.net.URLFilterFactory");

  private static final String URLFILTER_CLASS =
    NutchConf.get("urlfilter.class");

  private URLFilterFactory() {}                   

  private static URLFilter filter;

  
  public static URLFilter getFilter() {

    if (filter == null) {
      try {
        LOG.info("Using URL filter: " + URLFILTER_CLASS);
        Class filterClass = Class.forName(URLFILTER_CLASS);
        filter = (URLFilter)filterClass.newInstance();
      } catch (Exception e) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Couldn't create "+URLFILTER_CLASS, e);
      }
    }

    return filter;

  }
