Given the following java code, determine whether it contains an instance of the adapter design pattern playing the role of adapter.

You should read the entire code snippet carefully. Then answer with YES or NO in capital letters. Finally, In 2-3 short sentences, explain why that is the answer

CODE:


package CH.ifa.draw.figures;

import java.awt.Point;

import CH.ifa.draw.framework.DrawingView;
import CH.ifa.draw.framework.Locator;
import CH.ifa.draw.standard.LocatorHandle;


public class PolyLineHandle extends LocatorHandle {

	private int fIndex;
	private Point fAnchor;

   
	public PolyLineHandle(PolyLineFigure owner, Locator l, int index) {
		super(owner, l);
		fIndex = index;
	}

	public void invokeStart(int  x, int  y, DrawingView view) {
		fAnchor = new Point(x, y);
	}

	public void invokeStep (int x, int y, int anchorX, int anchorY, DrawingView view) {
		myOwner().setPointAt(new Point(x, y), fIndex);
	}

	private PolyLineFigure myOwner() {
		return (PolyLineFigure)owner();
	}
}
