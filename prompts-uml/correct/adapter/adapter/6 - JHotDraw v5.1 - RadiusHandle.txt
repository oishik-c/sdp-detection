CODE:
@startuml
class CH.ifa.draw.figures.RadiusHandle {
- Point fRadius
- RoundRectangleFigure fOwner
- {static} int OFFSET
+ <<Create>> RadiusHandle(RoundRectangleFigure)
+ void invokeStart(int,int,DrawingView)
+ void invokeStep(int,int,int,int,DrawingView)
+ Point locate()
+ void draw(Graphics)
}
