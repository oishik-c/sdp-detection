Given the following uml code, determine whether it contains an instance of the adapter design pattern playing the role of adapter.

You should read the entire code snippet carefully. Then answer with YES or NO in capital letters. Finally, In 2-3 short sentences, explain why that is the answer

CODE:
@startuml
class CH.ifa.draw.figures.ElbowHandle {
- int fSegment
- int fLastX
+ <<Create>> ElbowHandle(LineConnection,int)
+ void invokeStart(int,int,DrawingView)
+ void invokeStep(int,int,int,int,DrawingView)
- boolean isVertical(Point,Point)
+ Point locate()
+ void draw(Graphics)
- int constrainX(int)
- int constrainY(int)
- LineConnection ownerConnection()
}
