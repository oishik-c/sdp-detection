You should read the entire code snippet carefully. Then answer with YES or NO in capital letters. Finally, In 2-3 short sentences, explain why that is the answer

CODE:
@startuml
class CH.ifa.draw.contrib.PolygonScaleHandle {
- Point fOrigin
- Point fCurrent
- Polygon fOrigPoly
+ <<Create>> PolygonScaleHandle(PolygonFigure)
+ void invokeStart(int,int,Drawing)
+ void invokeStep(int,int,Drawing)
+ void invokeEnd(int,int,Drawing)
+ Point locate()
~ Point getOrigin()
+ void draw(Graphics)
}
