Given the following uml code, determine whether it contains an instance of the composite design pattern playing the role of leaf.

You should read the entire code snippet carefully. Then answer with YES or NO in capital letters. Finally, In 2-3 short sentences, explain why that is the answer

CODE:
@startuml
class CH.ifa.draw.contrib.TriangleFigure {
~ {static} double[] rotations
# int fRotation
+ <<Create>> TriangleFigure()
+ <<Create>> TriangleFigure(Point,Point)
+ Vector handles()
+ void rotate(double)
+ Polygon polygon()
+ void draw(Graphics)
+ Insets connectionInsets()
+ boolean containsPoint(int,int)
+ Point center()
+ Point chop(Point)
+ Object clone()
+ void write(StorableOutput)
+ void read(StorableInput)
}
